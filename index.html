I have worked in IT for fourteen years mostly as a Java developer and now as a techlead.
I currently work at National Bank of Canada and by the way we recruit in my team so don&#8217;t hesitate to ping me.
I am also a Montreal Jug leader.
I write a blog about development and techlead stuff.
And of course you can interact with me on Twitter.</p></div></aside></section><section id="the_hard_life_of_a_techlead"><h2>The Hard Life of a Techlead</h2><div class="imageblock" style=""><img src="images/cover.png" alt="cover" width="25%" /></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/-/fr/Xavier-Bouclet/e/B08RQKPM15/">The Hard Life of a Techlead</a></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>1 Free copy to win : tweet with #thehardlifeofatechlead and #confoo.</p></div>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>I like my techlead job so much that I decided 2 years ago to write about that.
My goal is to help me exchange with people interested in leading tech teams.
If you are interested by a free copy of the book you can tweet with #thehardlifeofatechlead and #confoo.</p></div></aside></section></section>
<section id="what_is_a_techlead"><h2>What is a techlead ?</h2><div class="paragraph"><p>The techlead is a combination of the words <strong>technical</strong> and <strong>leader</strong>.</p></div>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>The word techlead is a combination of the words technical/technics and leader.
A leader is someone at the head of a group of people whose goal is to achieve a common goal.
For the technical part, it means the techniques and practices in the group.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I am gonna elaborate that in the following slides.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I had to choose the most interesting content of my book so I am gonna focus on :
- common mistakes of techleads
- vision
- how to build a dream team</p></div></aside></section>
<section><section id="common_mistakes_and_solution"><h2>Common mistakes and solution</h2><div class="quoteblock"><blockquote>Success is walking from failure to failure while staying motivated.</blockquote><div class="attribution">&#8212; Winston Churchill</div></div><aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>This quote is interesting because we cannot really learn the techlead work at school.
It&#8217;s learned through practise.
So my first advice would be keep practising.</p></div></aside></section><section id="develop_100_of_your_time"><h2>Develop 100% of your time</h2><div class="paragraph"><p>To code, or not to code, that is the question.</p></div>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>When a techlead don&#8217;t code he won&#8217;t be able to do his job effectively because his leadership will be called into question.
But it&#8217;s the same if he code all the time.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In short use your time wisely.</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>do not get on the critical path</p></li><li><p>leave time for the team</p></li><li><p>leave time to build the vision</p></li></ul></div></aside></section><section id="percentages"><h2>Percentages</h2><table class="tableblock frame-all grid-all" style="width:100%"><colgroup><col style="width:50%" /><col style="width:50%" /></colgroup><thead><tr><th class="tableblock halign-left valign-top">Task</th><th class="tableblock halign-left valign-top">Percentage</th></tr><tbody><tr><td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class="tableblock">Coding</p></td><td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class="tableblock">30%</p></td></tr><tr><td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class="tableblock">Motivate the team</p></td><td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class="tableblock">30%</p></td></tr><tr><td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class="tableblock">Support / Organize the team</p></td><td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class="tableblock">30%</p></td></tr><tr><td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class="tableblock">Innovation</p></td><td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class="tableblock">10%</p></td></tr></table>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>These are the percentages I try to follow to be an effective techlead.
- coding : it&#8217;s to keep your legitimacy at the highest
- motivate the team : it&#8217;s to solve problems, reduce team difficulties and help to have a good athmosphere.
- support and organize the team : it&#8217;s to improve knowledge sharing and collaboration
- innovation : it&#8217;s to keep yourself and the team motivated</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>These percentages are a guideline not a rule sometimes you will have to focus on only one aspect.
But try to get back to these balanced percentages.</p></div></aside></section><section id="not_handling_the_human_side_of_the_team"><h2>Not handling the human side of the team</h2><div class="paragraph"><p>As a coder you craft your tools. As a techlead you craft your team.</p></div>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>You need to help resolve conflict in the team.
Indeed if you don&#8217;t, the motivation of the team will drop.
Usually it&#8217;s not the strength of the techlead but you need to work on it.
Most of the time conflicts are easily resolved
but sometimes it  does mean to separate from a team member for the good of the team.</p></div></aside></section><section id="be_the_only_one_to_decide"><h2>Be the only one to decide</h2><div class="imageblock" style=""><img src="images/boss-vs-leader-800x800.png" alt="boss vs leader 800x800" width="50%" /></div>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>If the techlead is the only one to decide the other team members will disengage and the team spirit will suffer.
So you need to help the team members reach a consensus by themselves.
When a decision has not been reached by the team you need to decide and explain the reasons of your decision.</p></div></aside></section><section id="not_guiding_the_team"><h2>Not guiding the team</h2><div class="imageblock" style=""><img src="images/wheel.png" alt="Wheel" /></div>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>To perfectly guide the team, it&#8217;s necessary for the tech lead to prevent any problems that could occur.
Here is a non-exhaustive list of potential disorders that should be monitored:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>keep a realistic scope of delivery</p></li><li><p>allow dubious managerial decisions to be imposed</p></li><li><p>be forced to add new members in the team without ensuring that they integrate into the team</p></li></ul></div></aside></section><section id="not_handling_team_discussion"><h2>Not handling team discussion</h2><div class="ulist"><ul><li class="fragment"><p>tab vs space</p></li><li class="fragment"><p>gradle vs maven</p></li><li class="fragment"><p>javascript vs typescript</p></li></ul></div>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>Joke aside, long procrastination over the choice of a solution or a path must be resolved as quickly as possible,
even if it means to have to return on the subject when new elements are brought to the attention of the team.
Anyway you don&#8217;t need to wait for complete information. Usually 70% of the complete information on a problem is enough to decide.</p></div></aside></section><section id="accuse_team_members_of_problems"><h2>Accuse team members of problems</h2><div class="paragraph"><p>The techlead is responsible for the team.</p></div>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>No matter what issues the team faces, as a leader, the techlead is in charge. So he is responsible.
In any case, this is the mentality that the techlead must have.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>That&#8217;s it for the common mistakes, now let&#8217;s talk about the vision.</p></div></aside></section></section>
<section><section id="the_vision"><h2>The vision</h2><div class="quoteblock"><blockquote>A strong team can take any crazy vision and turn it into reality.</blockquote><div class="attribution">&#8212; John Carmack - Oculus VR CTO</div></div><aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>The vision is the glue that bring people to become a team.
It needs to motivate the team members.</p></div></aside></section><section id="define_your_vision"><h2>Define your vision</h2><div class="paragraph"><p>What should you determine when you think about the vision for your team?</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>quality rules and processes</p></li><li><p>security rules and processes</p></li><li><p>the technological objectives for the product</p></li><li><p>delivery objectives</p></li><li><p>team culture</p></li></ul></div>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>Define the highest expectations possible on all the criteria.
Determine a path with small steps and start to work on it.</p></div></aside></section><section id="requirement_on_quality"><h2>Requirement on quality</h2><div class="paragraph"><p>Quality is essential, the rules need to be stronger over time.</p></div>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>You have to see how to move from the current situation of the team to the objective and it&#8217;s best to go there
in successive steps with a distant target in mind.
If you are lucky enough to hit the target, look for one even further.</p></div></aside></section><section id="security_requirements"><h2>Security requirements</h2><div class="paragraph"><p>An exploited security breach can damage a company&#8217;s reputation and financial health.</p></div>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>You need to fix everything related to security as soon as possible.
So challenge regularly your code base with the security tools of your company and patch every issue.
But it&#8217;s a reactive way of doing things, so you are not in control.
So be proactive and migrate to new version of the libraries you use.
By example use a branch with snapshot version of the librairies you use and build that every day
Work peacefully to resolve issues with the new version and when the it&#8217;s released you are ready.</p></div></aside></section><section id="technological_innovation"><h2>Technological innovation</h2><div class="paragraph"><p>The technological objectives are not there to have fun technically (ok maybe a little&#8230;&#8203;).</p></div>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>The technological objectives have to serve needs back.
For example, bringing in new technology to prepare a team for other developments that will come later.
Be open minded to change.
Try not to get locked into a technology to be able to evolve towards something better and avoid doing legacy stuff.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>On the plus side, technical innovation helps recruitment.</p></div></aside></section><section id="delivery_objectives"><h2>Delivery objectives</h2><div class="paragraph"><p>On this point, we are in 2021, so my delivery goals are basically at all times and automatically.</p></div>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>But that&#8217;s not necessarily the case when I get somewhere.
So you have to work on this target and put all the tools in place to get there.</p></div></aside></section><section id="team_culture"><h2>Team culture</h2><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>transparency</p></li><li><p>the requirement</p></li><li><p>mobilization</p></li><li><p>improving and sharing knowledge</p></li><li><p>empower team members</p></li></ul></div>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>To improve team culture, I try to work on these items.</p></div></aside></section></section>
<section><section id="build_a_dream_team"><h2>Build a dream team</h2><div class="quoteblock"><blockquote>Great things in business are never done by one person. They&#8217;re done by a team of people.</blockquote><div class="attribution">&#8212; Steve Jobs</div></div></section><section id="prerequisites"><h2>Prerequisites</h2><div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>a salary that is in line with the responsibilities and the standard of living that the person desires</p></li><li><p>a pace of work that allows to have a correct professional / personal life balance</p></li><li><p>a favorable context</p></li><li><p>the material to work</p></li></ul></div></section><section id="recruitment"><h2>Recruitment</h2><div class="paragraph"><p>Don&#8217;t look for the best coder. Look for the best fit in the team.</p></div>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>The golden rule for recruiting is not to recruit by default.
I mean it&#8217;s better to wait a long time for the right person than to have the wrong person.
Sometimes adding someone to a team lowers its productivity forever.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This point is sometimes difficult to convey to the management team, but you have to hold on.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Recruiting well facilitates the smooth running of the team.</p></div></aside></section><section id="delegate"><h2>Delegate</h2><div class="paragraph"><p>All knowledge must be shared with any member of the team in order to facilitate the development of the team&#8217;s skills.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The point is not to have someone who keeps the knowledge to himself.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Not even the techlead.</p></div>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>One of the aspects of knowledge transfer is also the delegation of the role of techlead.
Indeed, the techlead should not be the bottleneck of the team.
Backups must be found for tasks that require the attention of the techlead.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>On the other hand, the techlead retains responsibility for the vision.
He must therefore keep a check when he delegates something to ensure that the course towards the vision holds good.
This is done by gradually reducing the number of checks on things delegated.
If the delegation does not work, do not hesitate to take the reins on the things delegated.</p></div></aside></section><section id="accountability"><h2>Accountability</h2><div class="paragraph"><p>We succeed together or we fail together.</p></div>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>Each member of the team is responsible for the overall quality of the developments.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>As such, he must verify the work of his colleagues.
This verification is done, essentially, in a public and democratic manner by a peer review.</p></div></aside></section><section id="dealing_with_toxic_elements"><h2>Dealing with toxic elements</h2><div class="paragraph"><p>You may do everything to have a good team culture. Sometimes, it&#8217;s not enough.</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>list undesirable behaviors</p></li><li><p>have a meeting with the person to indicate what is not suitable</p></li><li><p>give a reaction time to give the person a chance to change</p></li><li><p>if nothing is done: separate from the person</p></li></ul></div>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>If you don&#8217;t do anything, you will loose legitimacy with the other members of the team.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Your action must be weighted according to the seniority of the person and what he may undergo in his personal life.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Separating from a person does not necessarily mean that the person loses his job.
The rest of the process is not up to you, but the person may be given a chance on another team in the company.
It all depends on the culture of the company you are in.
Regardless you need to prioritize the good of the team over one member.</p></div></aside></section><section id="give_credit_to_team_members"><h2>Give credit to team members</h2><div class="paragraph"><p>It&#8217;s important to give developers the credit they deserve.</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul><li><p>let them make presentations or trainings on their expertise</p></li><li><p>ask their opinion</p></li></ul></div>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>What I mean by that is that when a team member masters a subject as well, or even better than the techlead,
do not hesitate to put him forward.</p></div></aside></section><section id="advertise"><h2>Advertise</h2><div class="paragraph"><p>It&#8217;s about making public what is attractive in the team.</p></div>
<aside class="notes"><div class="paragraph"><p>In general, I prioritize two things, the innovative technological stack (remember what I said on the vision), good team culture
But the truth is, these two things help attract talent using the world&#8217;s oldest advertising method, word of mouth
Who are the team&#8217;s best ambassadors ? The developers themselves.
In addition, with a strong team culture, they are committed to bring in developers who will integrate well into the team.</p></div></aside></section><section id="advertise_2"><h2>Advertise</h2><div class="paragraph"><p>It&#8217;s about making public what is attractive in the team.</p></div>
